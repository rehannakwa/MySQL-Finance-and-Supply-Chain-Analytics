# MySQL-Finance-and-Supply-chain-Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Short Info
SQL-based project focusing on financial and supply chain analytics using MySQL. Includes sales reports, market trends, customer insights, and forecast accuracy analysis to support business decision-making.

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project is built to analyze **finance and supply chain data** for Atliq Hardware using **MySQL**. It addresses performance issues caused by large Excel datasets by migrating analysis to a relational database.  

The project leverages advanced SQL techniquesâ€”joins, user-defined functions, stored procedures, views, temporary tables, and window functionsâ€”to create insights on **sales, market performance, and customer behavior**.  

Key reports include:  
- Product-wise and customer-wise sales reports  
- Monthly and yearly gross/net sales reports  
- Top-performing markets and customers  
- Supply chain performance analytics  
- Forecast accuracy comparison across years  

By combining technical SQL capabilities with analytical problem-solving, the project improves decision-making, enhances reporting efficiency, and deepens understanding of business performance.

 ## Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware has launched a project to address performance issues arising from the expansion of Excel files. To combat this challenge, the company wanted a team of data analysts who would leverage MySQL as their database and help analyze data, extract valuable insights and gain an understanding of the company's financial position. 
The primary objective is to enhance decison making and elevate overall performance.

**My course of action:** &nbsp; Assuming the role of a data analyst, I utilized MySQL as my database platform to tackle targeted inquiries regarding sales market dynamics, market analysis, and customer behavior. My primary objective is to unwrap insights that offer strategic direction and deepens the understanding of market trends and customer preferences.

I formulated SQL queries for the following requests. 
  1) Product Wise Sales Report for Croma in 2021
  2) Monthly Gross Sales Report for Croma 
  3) Yearly Gross Sales Report for Croma
  4) Top n Customers by Net Sales 
  5) Top Markets by Net Sales 
  6) Supply Chain Analytics Report for the year 2021 
  7) Forecast Accuracy Report (2020 vs 2021)
